UI/UX PROCESS:

1. DISCOVERY / ASSESSMENT / USER RESEARCH - This will help you understand the problem you are trying to solve.

2. WIREFRAMING - Also know as the design concept. This is all about generating ideas and validating those ideas if it is going to be added in the design.

3. VISUAL DESIGN / PROTOTYPING - In this area it should all about the content. Discussion about specific colors, images, fonts and so on should be avoided here as much as possible.
                               - This stage is to make sure your ideas make sense.

4. TESTING - The design will be tested over and over until it meets the user expectations.

ONCE THE UX DESIGNER IS HAPPY, ONLY THEN HE CAN PASS THE WIREFRAME / PROTOTYPE TO THE UI DESIGNER

5. DEVELOPMENT & PRODUCTION - This where UI takes place like deciding what color, fonts, images, and so on.
